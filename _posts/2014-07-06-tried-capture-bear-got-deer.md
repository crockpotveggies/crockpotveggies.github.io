title: Got Deer, No Bear, But...
---

In a follow up to my most <a href="http://crockpotveggies.com/2014/07/04/hunting-for-bear-photography.html"> recent post</a> I set out to see if I could photograph bears out in the British Columbia backcountry. The local black bears didn't make an appearance, but there's hope I still might see some <em>type</em> of bear.

Driving into the BC Backcountry near Duffey Lake Provincial Park, we came across an area where we found a very large amount of scat on the road. Guessing it to be bear droppings, we stopped the car and set up the camera on the side of the road. On our return we spotted our markers and picked up the camera. We had two interesting findings:

+ Was the ONLY group there the whole weekend
+ Our only other find was a group of deer

We only saw one tow truck taking a car back to civilization which the camera picked up, and the rest of the time we had the entire backcountry for at least 30km to ourselves. It makes it a more attractive place to head back and try to take some more shots. The camera did pick up a group of deer (photo above) feeding in the morning, and that was about it.

But there's still an opportunity to see a "bear" from this weekend. I had the audacity to sample some moss from a couple places to see if I could find a Waterbear.

If you've never heard of a Waterbear, the real name for the creatures is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrade" target="_blank">Tardigrade</a> and there's over 1,500 species of them. They are also called "moss piglets" since they can be commonly found feeding in moss all around the world. I'll be taking the sample to a lab to look at some of the species under the microscope when I have some extra time.

So was the photography experiment a success? Well, looks like I'm just getting started.
