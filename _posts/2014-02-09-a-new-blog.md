I've been so busy heads down working this last year I haven't had a chance to share anything new. So behold, a new website with an old and familiar name.

Just one year ago I joined 3 Tier Logic, built an entirely new software platform for the company, and endulged in a couple of exciting projects. After working with Scala exclusively for two years prior, I got a chance to take it to the next level and build a full service architecture from scratch. Platform3 is a software platform built entirely to handle different channels of marketing data and centralize it for super easy segmentation and analysis.

I'll have a chance to talk about work projects - mostly Platform3 - on this new site and also indulge in a couple projects of my own. I also had the chance to completely ditch SQL databases and use both key/value stores and memory-based search tools. Unconvential to say the least. 

On top of the aforementioned, I'll even throw in some ski trips. Finally took the time to convert my skis for touring and not rely on a pass this year!
