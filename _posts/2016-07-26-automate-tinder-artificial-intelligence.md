title: Automating Tinder with Artificial Intelligence
---

Back in 2014 I built a prototype that automated Tinder for me using Eigenfaces. After receiving an overwhelming response to the project, I've put together a team and made the technology accessible to everyone.

<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bernie-a.i./id1068738111">Bernie A.I.</a> is the child of countless hours of research, experimentation, and bug fixing. I realized I wasn't the only one who wanted to find a better way of dealing with the overwhelming time it takes to use online dating. I believe there's so much that can be offered by having a wide-open space for singles to meet, and with the right mindset it's possible to make the experience a desirable one.

For those who don't know the history, Bernie is aptly named after Bernd Dittrich, a dear friend and promising athlete who passed away in 2009 (sorry Bernie Sanders fans!). Dittrich was loved by everyone around him, and we couldn't get enough of his terrible jokes. Bernie was originally from Austria and had moved to Oklahoma to pick up his football career. After moving to Canada to join the Simon Fraser University team (now part of the NCAA), he was just starting to peak in his football career when we lost him. Bernie was a dormmate and practically a roommate, and I'll never forget how loving he was in his own relationship to his girlfriend.

Bernie A.I. relies on latest practices in artificial intelligence and uses convolutional neural networks under the hood. After face-palming over my mistake to use Eigenfaces, I'm completely blown away by the accuracy we're given with neural nets - we're confidently seeing accuracy in the mid 80%. Just like Tesla autopilot, "undo" actions fed into Bernie help us to further increase his accuracy. Better yet, the training times in Bernie have been reduced to 17% of what it used to take, a tremendous improvement from the early days.

Each Bernie comes pre-trained, so he gets working for you the same day he signs up. This means he can start working on limited knowledge, and the more you train Bernie the better he will get at understanding the type of match you want.

Bernie does everything the Tinderbox prototype did, and more. Bernie brings a more personified (and human) experience to online dating by summarizing everything to its master with words, and we leave the graphs and charts and stats to the background. Bernie still opens conversations with fun and random questions, and within a couple months time we'll be turning on the ability for Bernie to start a conversation based on the context of a match's profile picture. We already know that matches who receive contextual introductory messages are much more likely to respond, and we're doing everything we can to make this perfect.

Most of all, Bernie is more <em>accessible</em>. Bernie's mobile app has much more to offer than the Tinderbox prototype's web interface, and the Bernie team is working non-stop behind the scenes to keep features updated and ensure his algorithms are performing exactly as expected. Bernie reports his history via his "efforts", and if you feel like he made the wrong choice you can "undo" by swiping left and tapping the undo button. Each undone effort contributes to Bernie's training and makes him smarter.

I couldn't be more excited by Bernie to see where he goes next. There's much more in the pipe to make him better, and the team and I are only just getting started...
