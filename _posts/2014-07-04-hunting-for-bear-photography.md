title: Hunting for Bear Photography
---

I've been spending a lot of time in the outdoors during my weekends, most of my time being spent in the awesome Duffey Lake Provincial Park. We've been doing a lot of hut camping, and on my most recent trip I stumbled along bear scat on the trail.

Being the curious guy I am, I decided to put together a side project to investigate. After researching some solutions I could use to track the bears, I purchased a <a href="http://www.gsmoutdoors.com/shopping/stealth-cam/no-glo-scouting-cameras/skout-NoGlo.aspx">Skout NoGlo</a> from London Drugs. The Skout is an outdoor game camera used by hunters to investigate an area for potential wildlife. I'll be lugging this up with me on my trip this weekend (and others) to set up a few camera traps.

I did some research on how I could detect a bear. I figured I'd need to attract it to the trap site through baiting. What I'm considering:

+ bait with almond butter and a natural meat (fish?)
+ elevating the bait 2 ft from ground
+ elevating camera 6 ft from ground
+ angling camera downwards at distance of 20ft away
+ cleaning up the site to prevent future bear visits

If you haven't been to Duffey Lake Provincial Park it's an area well worth exploring. There are huts everywhere throughout the park, half of those that don't require a reservation. There are a lot of old lakes that were carved out by ancient glaciers sliding down from the mountains. And the scenery is insane.

I'll post an update here on whether I get any results. I'm sure I'll get at least a curious squirrel.
