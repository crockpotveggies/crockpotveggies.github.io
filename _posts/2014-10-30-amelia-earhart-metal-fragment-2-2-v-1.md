title: Reopening Fragment 2-2-V-1, Amelia Earhart's Plane?

On October 29, <a href="www.history.com/news/researchers-identify-fragment-of-amelia-earharts-plane/?cmpid=Social_Facebook_HITH_10292014_1" target="_blank">TIGHAR gained attention</a> speculating that growing evidence suggests fragment 2-2-V-1 may belong to Amelia Earhart's plane. However, this is far from new, and has been refuted as far back as 1992.

TIGHAR's Richard Gillespie was an author of an NTSB report released March 4, 1992, outlining metallurgical analysis of 11 different fragments from Gardner Island, now known as Nikumaroro. The evidence was far from conclusive, although there was speculation the metal piece may have belonged to a Lockheed 10 - Earhart's airplane. A panel assembled in coordination with Earhart researcher Elgen Long, who is also my grandfather, unanimously concluded that the piece could not have belonged to a Lockheed 10. This panel included a previous Lockheed engineer, Edward Werner, who had experience with Earhart's model of airplane.

The problem with TIGHAR's latest speculation is that there still isn't enough evidence to contradict original analysis of 2-2-V-1. Additionally, that same fragment was found to match the top wing of a PBY Catalina (image above) . TIGHAR has made inconsistent claims of the origin of 2-2-V-1, originally stating they believed the piece came from the belly of Earhart's airplane. That position has changed multiple times, where TIGHAR is currently postulating it could be part of a hatch or escape window. There is good reason to consider the evidence inconclusive since there isn't a strong fit anywhere on the airplane.

When Earhart <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amelia_Earhart#1937_world_flight" target="_blank">crashed her airplane in Hawaii</a> on her first world flight attempt, a report of approximately 20 pages was produced outlining mechinal and engineering fixes made to her plane. No where in that record, or any other engineering record at Lockheed, suggests a modification like 2-2-V-1 exists.

I'm a little concerned that this piece of evidence has been recycled in the news since much research has already been done to determine it is <em>not</em> of Lockheed origin. There's also further reason to doubt that Earhart would have ended up more than 350 miles away from Howland island at Nikumaroro. This is not only a contradiction of radio logs recorded by the US Coast Guard Cutter Itasca, who received very strong radio signal from Earhart near Howland, but also received multiple strong messages she was low on fuel. There is little chance she would have had enough fuel to travel the great distance to Nikumaroro. The chance of her plane floating there is also slim, given it was not buoyant.
